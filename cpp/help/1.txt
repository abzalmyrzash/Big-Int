PAGE 1 - INTRODUCTION

This is a program that uses the RSA public-key encryption algorithm.

To get started, you need to generate a pair of keys - one public (.pub file) and
one private (.prv file). It may take up to a few minutes, but you only need to
do it once.

You will share your public key with your friend, and obviously, keep your priva-
te key to yourself.

Your friend can then use your public key to encrypt a message, which you can de-
crypt with your private key (and ideally no one else).

Similarly, you will ask for your friend's public key to send him encrypted mes-
sages only he can decrypt.

Make sure that you have the required files in the program's keys directory and
have set the keys before encryption/decryption.

Every algorithm including arbitrary-precision math was implemented from scratch
by myself (except for CSPRNG), so use it at your own risk. In theory, it should
be secure, since it generates 2048-bit RSA keys and the CSPRNG is provided by
the OS. At least more secure than the old 64-bit version. It is also slow, how-
ever.
