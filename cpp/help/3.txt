PAGE 3 - HOW DOES THIS EVEN WORK?

The RSA algorithm outputs three numbers: N, E and D. Though it first needs to
secretly generate two prime numbers, P and Q, which are multiplied to make N.
N is part of both the public and private keys. E is part of the public key and
is used for encryption, and D is part of the private key used for encryption.

Long story short, the security of the algorithm rests on the fact that it is
hard to factor N into P and Q. Because once you know P and Q, you can calculate
the private number D from the public numbers N and E. And boom, you are dead.

Also, theoretically you can "decrypt" plaintext, and then "encrypt" it back
to get your original plaintext. Not in this program though because there is an
additional step of Base64 encoding/decoding (binary data <-> text conversion)
that breaks when you try to decode plaintext that contains non-Base64 symbols.

However, the process of "decrypting" plaintext (or rather the hash of plaintext)
is legitimately used for digital signatures. May or may not add this to the pro-
gram later. Should first extend the algorithm to generate larger keys.
